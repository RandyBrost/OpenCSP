# Open CSP

This is the collection of library and application code, originally started at the Sandia Laboratories National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF), to create one place for the CSP community to develop python packages.

# app

Top-level application code, organized in directories.

# common

General-purpose code and data to support writing a variety of applications.
Code in app, example, and wip may call code in common/lib, but not vice versa.

# doc

Sphinx documentation that will soon be available on readthedocs.org.

# example

Example uses of the code, possibly complex.
(Tests cases also provide a rich set of simpler examples; these are distributed throughout the source code.)
