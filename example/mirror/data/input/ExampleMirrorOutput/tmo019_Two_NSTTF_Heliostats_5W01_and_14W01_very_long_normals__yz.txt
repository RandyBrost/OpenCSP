Title:
Two NSTTF Heliostats: 5W01 and 14W01 (very long normals)

Caption:
Two NSTTF heliostats.  5W01 modeled as a symmetric paraboloid with focal length f=55m.  14W01 modeled as a symmetric paraboloid with focal length f=186.8m.  Facet surfaces and canting have the same focal length.

Comments:
Render mirror surfaces and normals, facet outlines, and heliostat centroid.
