This code generates a flight plan for UFACET-s and UFACET-v. It should be turned into an application that depends on common/lib instead of duplicating much of that same functionality here.

This application should be set up to mimic the other applications in this directory. Namely, it should be structured as:
- lib
- test
- [application].py
