"""Python script that provides an example of how to process SOFAST data
of the Sandia temperature chamber experiment. In this experiment, a CSP
mirror was placed in a large temerature chamber. An installation of SOFAST
was set up outside of the temperature chamber so that when the chamber
doors were opened, SOFAST could immediately take a measurement. This was
done for a range of temperatures from +5C to -50C. This example will walk
a user through how to automatically process such data, how to automatically
plot slope maps, and how to generate slope difference plots to show the
change in slope from room temerature.
